<!--
  This is a simple example / template impress.js slide show. The goal is to be
  easier to read for a first timer than the official and very feature rich
  demo by bartaz (http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js/). It's also a very
  traditional presentation that looks like slides (square screens with bullet
  points...), again to make a first timer feel more at home. From this simple
  presentation you can then go on to more powerful impress.js presentations!
  
  This example is hopefully helpful for people that want to create both
  simple and (eventually) awesome presentations in impress.js and comfortable
  doing that directly in HTML.

        <p>Why this project?</p>
        <div style="display: inline-block; font-size: 20px">
          Our group brainstormed for a while and then decided, a restaurant
          website will be suitable for the project as it is neither too static
          nor too dynamic. Since it will be our first web development project
          the idea seemed great as we will be able to use what we learned in the
          class in this project.
          <br />
          Due to COVID-19 restaurants have been greatly affected. Since the
          restaurants can no longer allow people to dine in, we decided to add
          an ordering system to our website.
          <br />
          Using our delivery system people can order food then our fictional
          restaurant can deliver the required order to the same individual.
          Thus, ensuring a contactless, safe and hygienic food delivery.

          We decided to build our website in tie with the modern design trends.
          You will notice that our webiste has sort of a minimalistic feel to it
          and is also very modern.
          <br />
          Every component is made from scratch using css and no css frameworks
          have been used.

            </li>
